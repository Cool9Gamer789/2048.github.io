# 2048 Game

## How to Play

The goal of 2048 is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

1.  **Movement:** Use the **arrow keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) on your keyboard to move the tiles.
2.  **Combining Tiles:** When two tiles with the same number touch, they **merge into one tile** with the sum of their values (e.g., two '2' tiles become one '4' tile).
3.  **New Tiles:** After each move, a new '2' or '4' tile will appear in a random empty spot on the grid.
4.  **Winning:** The game is won when you successfully create a **2048 tile**.
5.  **Losing:** The game is lost when the grid is full and there are no more possible moves (i.e., no adjacent tiles with the same number that can be merged).
